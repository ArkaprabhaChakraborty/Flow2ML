## Introduction 
<p>Write only a Few Lines of
Machine learning code using
Flow2Ml</p>
 
<p>Quickly design and customize pre-processing workflow in machine learning.
Obtain training, validating samples with only 3 lines of code using Flow2ML toolkit

Check Installation and sample code to flow into your ML model much faster and efficiently.</p>
 
## Why Flow2ML
<p>Flow2ML is an open-source library to make the machine learning process much simpler. It loads the image data and applies the given filters and returns train data, train labels, validation data, and validation labels.
For all these steps it just takes 3 lines of code. It mostly helps beginners in the field of machine learning and deep learning where the user would deal with image-related data.</p>


## Programming languages and technologies used:
1. Python
2. HTML
3. Numpy library
4. OpenCV
5. Machine Learning

## Download all Dependencies by :
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
	
## Getting Started 

Flow2ML for Python can be installed from Source,Pypi and Docker container installation methods.

   ## From Source

   $ git clone https://github.com/flow2ml/Flow2ML.git <br />
   $ cd flow2ML <br />

   Or using PIP:

   $ git clone https://github.com/flow2ml/Flow2ML.git <br />
   $ cd flow2ML <br /
   $ pip install . <br />
   
   ## From Pypi
   $ pip install flow2ml <br />
   
   ## From Docker Image / Container
   Clone this repo and cd into it: <br />
   $ git clone https://github.com/flow2ml/Flow2ML.git <br />
   $ cd flow2ML <br /

   Build the docker image: <br />
   $ docker build -t flow2ml . <br />

   Now you can run any of the code in this directory:

   Run the container,  and specifying which code to run. <br />
   -v : The volume on which repo code is mounted <br />
   Replace "script.py" with the name of your code you'd like to run <br />
   Replace "pwd" with the path of the example file you'd like to run. <br />

   $ docker run -it --rm \ -v $(pwd)/:/root/flow2ml/ python script.py

## Sample Code
Sample code for using the package can be found [here.](examples/README.md)
